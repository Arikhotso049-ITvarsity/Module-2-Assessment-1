                            <h3>TIGER</h3>

                            <p>
                                Tigers are the largest members of the cat family,
                                belonging to the genus Panthera. They are known for
                                their powerful bodies, sharp teeth, and distinctive
                                orange coats with black stripes. Each tiger’s stripe
                                pattern is unique.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Tigers are native to parts of Asia and can be found in
                                forests, grasslands, mangroves, and wetlands. They are
                                solitary and territorial animals, spending most of
                                their time alone except during mating or when a mother
                                is raising her cubs.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Tigers are carnivorous hunters that rely on stealth
                                and strength to catch prey such as deer and wild boar.
                                Although they are strong swimmers, they prefer dense
                                cover where they can ambush their prey.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You will find the tigers at pen T15, near the forest
                                habitat section, close to the river walkway.
