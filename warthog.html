          <h3>WARTHOG</h3>

          <p>
            Warthogs are wild pigs native to sub-Saharan Africa, easily recognized by their large
            tusks and wart-like facial bumps. They are social animals, often found in family groups
            called sounders. Warthogs are mostly grazers, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and
            bark, but they will also eat small animals occasionally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Warthogs have a stocky body, a large head, and curved tusks used for defense and digging.
            They have sparse hair and a mane along their spine. When threatened, warthogs can run
            quickly and often retreat to burrows, which they either dig themselves or take over from
            other animals.
          </p>

          <p>
            They inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. Warthogs are adaptable and can
            survive in areas with scarce water, though they prefer habitats near water sources.
          </p>

          <strong>
            <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
          </strong>

          <p>
            You will find the warthogs at pen W6, in the open savannah enclosure.
