          <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>

          <p>
            The Lost Forest is a peaceful and mysterious area filled with tall trees,
            winding paths, and the sounds of nature all around you. It is the perfect
            place to escape the busy parts of the park and enjoy a calm, natural
            environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you explore the Lost Forest, you may encounter a variety of plant life
            and small animals that call this forest home. Shaded walkways and hidden
            corners make it an exciting place for visitors who enjoy adventure and
            discovery.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Lost Forest is ideal for nature walks, photography, and quiet reflection.
            It offers a cool, relaxing atmosphere, especially on warm days.

          <strong>
            <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p>
          </strong>

          <p>
            You will find the Lost Forest on the eastern side of the park, just beyond
            the lake and close to the nature trail.
