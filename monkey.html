          <h3>MONKEY</h3>

          <p>
            Monkeys are primates belonging to the infraorder Simiiformes, which includes Old World
            and New World monkeys. They are typically social, active, and intelligent animals,
            known for their agility and playful behavior. Monkeys are found in various habitats,
            including forests, savannahs, and mountains across Africa, Asia, and Central and South
            America.
          </p>

          <p>
            Monkeys vary greatly in size and appearance. Most have flexible limbs, long tails
            (except for some species), and opposable thumbs, allowing them to grasp branches and
            objects. They communicate using vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Monkeys are omnivorous, feeding on fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and small animals.
            They often live in troops, which provide protection and social interaction. Their
            intelligence allows them to use tools and solve problems in the wild.

          <p>
