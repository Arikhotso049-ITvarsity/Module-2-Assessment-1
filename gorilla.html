          <h3>GORILLA</h3>

          <p>
            Gorillas are large primates of the family Hominidae and the genus Gorilla.
            They are ground-dwelling herbivores native to the forests of central
            Sub-Saharan Africa. Gorillas are known for their intelligence, social
            behavior, and strong build. There are two species: the Eastern Gorilla
            (Gorilla beringei) and the Western Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), each with
            subspecies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gorillas have several distinctive features, including a broad chest,
            muscular arms, and a prominent sagittal crest on their skulls (especially
            in males). They have opposable thumbs and large hands, which help them
            manipulate objects, forage, and build nests. Adult males, called
            silverbacks, can weigh up to 200 kg (440 lb) and are the leaders of their
            groups.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and
            occasionally insects. They live in family groups and communicate through
            vocalizations, gestures, and body language.
          </p>

            <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
          </strong>

          <p>
            You will find the gorillas at pen H7, near the forested enclosure.
