          <h3>PANDA</h3>

          <p>
            Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are bears native to the mountain ranges of central
            China. They are famous for their distinctive black-and-white fur and gentle temperament.
            Pandas primarily feed on bamboo, although they may occasionally eat other plants or small
            animals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adult pandas have a robust body, round face, and large paws adapted for gripping bamboo
            stalks. They are generally solitary animals, communicating through vocalizations, scent
            markings, and body language. Pandas are excellent climbers and swimmers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pandas live in temperate forests with dense bamboo undergrowth, mostly in high-altitude
            regions. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, they are considered vulnerable, and
            conservation efforts are ongoing worldwide.
