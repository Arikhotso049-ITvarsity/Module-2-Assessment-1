          <h3>LION</h3>

          <p>
            Lions are large carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae, native to Africa
            and a small population in India (Asiatic lions). Known as the “king of the
            jungle,” lions are social animals living in groups called prides, which
            consist of related females, their offspring, and a small number of adult
            males.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lions have several distinctive features, including a muscular body, a deep
            chest, and a large head. Male lions have a prominent mane, which varies in
            color and size and provides protection during fights. Lions are powerful
            hunters, primarily feeding on large herbivores, though they also scavenge
            when the opportunity arises.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lions are found in grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands. They are
            territorial and communicate through roaring, scent marking, and body
            language. A pride works together to hunt and raise cubs.

            <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
          </strong>

          <p>
