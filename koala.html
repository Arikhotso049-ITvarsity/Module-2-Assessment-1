          <h3>KOALA</h3>

          <p>
            Koalas are marsupials native to eastern Australia, famous for their fluffy ears and
            spoon-shaped noses. They are arboreal, spending most of their time in eucalyptus trees,
            which also make up almost their entire diet. Koalas are generally solitary animals,
            communicating through soft grunts and bellows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Adult koalas have thick, grey fur and strong, sharp claws for climbing trees. Their
            specialized digestive system allows them to eat eucalyptus leaves, which are tough and
            low in nutrients. Koalas sleep up to 18–20 hours a day to conserve energy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Koalas live in eucalyptus forests and woodlands, usually near water sources. Due to
            habitat loss and bushfires, they are considered vulnerable, and conservation efforts
            are ongoing.

            <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
          </strong>

          <p>
            You will find the koalas at pen K9, in the tree-lined enclosure.
