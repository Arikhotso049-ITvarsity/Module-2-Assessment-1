          <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>

          <p>
            Gemsbok are large antelope of the family Bovidae and are native to the arid
            regions of southern Africa. They are well adapted to desert and semi-desert
            environments, especially the Kalahari Desert. Gemsbok are known for their
            striking appearance, with bold black-and-white facial markings and long,
            straight horns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both male and female gemsbok have long, sharp horns that can grow up to 85 cm
            (33 in) in length. These horns are used for defense against predators such as
            lions and hyenas. Gemsbok have strong, muscular bodies and are able to survive
            extreme heat by regulating their body temperature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gemsbok are herbivorous and feed on grasses, roots, tubers, and wild fruits.
            They can survive long periods without drinking water, as they obtain most of
            their moisture from the food they eat.
          </p>

          <strong>
            <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
          </strong>

          <p>
            You will find the gemsbok at pen G15, close to the desert habitat area.
