          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>

          <p>
            Giraffes are large mammals of the family Giraffidae and the order
            Artiodactyla. They are the tallest terrestrial animals, with long necks
            and legs that allow them to reach leaves high in trees. Giraffes are
            native to sub-Saharan Africa and are found in savannahs, grasslands, and
            open woodlands. Their unique coat patterns, made up of spots or patches,
            help with camouflage and vary among different populations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Giraffes have several distinctive features, the most notable being their
            long necks, which can measure up to 2 meters (6.6 ft). They use their
            prehensile tongues, which can be up to 45 cm (18 in) long, to grasp leaves
            and buds. Giraffes have ossicones, which are horn-like structures on their
            heads, and large eyes for spotting predators from afar. Their long legs
            allow them to run at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph) over short distances.
          </p>

          <p>
            Giraffes are herbivorous and primarily feed on leaves, flowers, and fruits
            from acacia and other trees. They can go without water for long periods,
            getting most of their moisture from their diet.
